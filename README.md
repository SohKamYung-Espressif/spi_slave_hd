# SPI Half-Duplex Example

This is an example of using SPI on ESP32 in half-duplex mode to
transfer data between an ESP32-S3 (master) and ESP32-C6 (slave). It is
based on the ESP-IDF [SPI Half-Duplex
Example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/spi_slave_hd).

This is intended to be a reference for implementing transfers using
QSPI.
